+ why does it log me in as the user i just logged out as even though i sign out of gmail in my browser...i think there's an access token cached in the background page.

+ account for multiple emails in friend bucket...maybe use hidden div or something

+ check that user is in database when entering contact

+ send link to user's email if they aren't in the database

+ contact autosuggestion

--change startup time to last login time
--have bg message popup when history is gathered!


--display email instead of firebaseUsername in sender field in history list
--ditto in the notification

--when i log in with google the old notifications pop up! oh no!
